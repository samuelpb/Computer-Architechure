Codes in C

In Computer Architecture, there were five main Projects, each introducting us into a new aspect of coding in C.

PA1:  
  PA1 was constructed of 8 parts, starting with something as simple as compressing a string to creating a Binary Search
  Tree or Linked lIst by the end. 
      The eight codes:
          Anagram: sorts the inputed strings characters into alphabetical order.
          BST: takes in instructions to insert, search for, or delete nodes in a binary search tree.
          List: takes in instructions to insert or delete nodes, then prints the remaining list
          Mexp: Matrix exponentiation. Takes in a matrix and mltiplies it to a given power.
          Rle: Compresses a string, so aaabbb beomes a3b3. Only compresses if the new string is shorter than the original.
          Sudoku:Checks a 9x9 grid to see if it follows the Sudoku rules, and also can check to see if 
          a puzzle with one or two empty spaces is solvable.
          Table:A very simple hash table that takes in nubers to insert, and can check whether numbers are present.
          Yell: Returns the string in all Caps.
